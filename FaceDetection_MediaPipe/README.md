This repository shows the code I did while learning to use [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/getting_started/python) face detection API.
The code differs from the one in the site tutorial, but for learning purposes, it was a better choice.

The code opens the selected webcam > runs the FaceDetection algorithm > pops up the webcam window > marks the faces (if any) and tracks them.
If you press the "ESC" key the process stops and the window closes

The result was basically same as shown in the gif below:
